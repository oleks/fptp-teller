\section{Social Choice}

Let a \emph{world} be a set of elements in a particular \emph{state}. Let an
\emph{alternative} be a collective state of a subset of the world. Let an
\emph{individual} be a subset of the world that possesses preference relations
over alternatives, i.e. prefers some alternatives to others. Let a
\emph{collective} be a set of individuals. A collective may, likewise, possess
preference relations over alternatives.

\emph{Social choice} is the study of transformation of individual preference
relations into collective preference relations.
