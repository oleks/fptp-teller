\chapter{FPTP}

A First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) election is among the simplest types of elections.
It is easy to understand, conduct and monitor on a small scale.

In its simplest incarnation, it is the ``raising of hands'' election. The
winner is the candidate with the highest number of raised hands. To ensure
anonimity, the voter may instead be asked to denote his choice on a piece of
paper, and cast it in a ballot box. Once all the votes have been cast, the
votes are tallied, and the candidate most frequently denoted, wins the
election.

The name ``first-past-the-post'' stems from horse racing, where the first horse
past a particular post wins the race. Unlike in horse racing however, there is
often a high chance of a tie in an FPTP election.

On a national scale, an FPTP ballot is typically a list of candidates written
out on a sheet of paper, and the voter is asked to mark their desired
candidate, and cast the ballot into a ballot box. The bllots in all the ballot
boxes are then tallied, and the candidate with the most marks wins the
election.
