\section*{Learning objectives}

The following is a list of project-specific learning objectives:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Analyse relevant literature and formally state a set of properties that
should hold for an FPTP tally system.

\item Formally specify at least one FPTP tally system using Z notation.

\item Formally verify that the above systems satisfy some subset of the above
properties. \label{property-verify}

\item Implement at least one of the above systems in SPARK.

\item Formally verify that the above implementations are correspond to their
respective specifications.

\item If multiple Z or SPARK specifications are completed, analyse their
respective benefits and pitfalls.

\end{enumerate}

The formal verification that certain properties hold (learning objective
\ref{property-verify}) can be done not for a system specified in Z, but in
SPARK. Indeed this may be easier with the SPARK tools at hand. In either case,
it is important to show that the SPARK implementation corresponds to a given Z
specification.
