Z notation is a formally specified language for writing formal specifications.
Its syntax, type system and semantics are formally defined by \cite{iso-z}. A
tutorial and a de-facto specification is provided by M. Spivey in \cite{zrm}.

Z builds upon the Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC), a
one-sorted theory of first-order logic. ZFC is an axiomatic set theory, i.e. a
theory of sets which avoids the paradoxes of na\"ive set theory due to
unrestricted comprehension.

To increase readability of formal specifications, Z notation allows for natural
language to be intermixed with the elements of the notation.
