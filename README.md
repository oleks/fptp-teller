A [first past the post][0] (FPTP) election is won by the candidate(s) with a
majority of the votes. The majority may be relative (most votes) or absolute (>
50%). In systems requiring an absolute majority, runoff elections may be held
if no candidate attains such a majority in the first round. A voter may vote
for exactly one candidate, typically in an anonymous manner.

FPTP is most common in states that descended from the British and French
Empires, e.g. UK, United States, Canada, India. It is the second most widely
used election system in the world, after [party-list proportional
representation][1] (PLPR). Roughly speaking, FPTP is often used for head of
state elections, while PLPR is often used for parliamentary elections. FPTP can
be used for parliamentary elections through the use of single-member elective
districts.

Once the votes have been cast, a mission critical process is necessary to count
the votes. This is done by a tally system. The purpose of this project is to
design an open source automated tally system for FPTP elections, formally
specified in [Z][2], implemented and verified in [SPARK][3].
