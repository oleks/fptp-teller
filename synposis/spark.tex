\section*{SPARK}

SPARK is a formally-specified programming language for writing formally
verified programs\cite{spark-lrm}. A comprehensive tutorial is provided by John
Barnes in \cite{barnes}.

SPARK is (1) a conservative subset of the Ada programming language, together
with (2) annotations as Ada comments, and (3) tools for verification of SPARK
programs. The annotations provide the semantic information necessary to guide
the verification. Verification is the process of confirming that the Ada code
enclosed in an annotation conforms to the annotation. This in turn may require
intermediate annotations, e.g. loop invariants.

The process of verification is only partially automated, but it can be checked
automatically whether a SPARK system is fully verified or not.

% a system with a low level of abstraction makes analysis difficult, as
% properties cannot be expressed compactly, if at all.
